    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for Sailfish OS Devices

    To run and debug an application on a Sailfish OS device, you must create connections
    from the development host to the device and add the device configurations to
    \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits}. Click \gui {Manage Kits} to add Sailfish OS
    devices to kits. For more information, see \l{Connecting Sailfish OS Devices}.

    Specifying run settings for Sailfish OS devices is very similar to
    \l{Specifying Run Settings for Linux-Based Devices}.
