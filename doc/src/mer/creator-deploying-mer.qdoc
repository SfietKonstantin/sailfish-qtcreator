    \title Deploying Applications to Sailfish OS Devices

    You can specify settings for deploying applications to Sailfish OS devices in the
    project .pro file. You can view the settings in the \gui {Run Settings}.

    When you run the application on a Sailfish OS device or on the emulator, \QC
    deploys the application as specified by the deploy steps.

    \section1 Copying Binary Files

    \image creator-mer-deploy-settings.png

    The \gui {Deploy by Copying Binaries} step determines that \QC uses the
    rsync file copying tool to transfer the files to the device or to the
    emulator.
