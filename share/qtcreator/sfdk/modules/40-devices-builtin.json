    "trDescription": "WORKING WITH DEVICES\n\nAvailable devices can be listed with the 'device list' command. Additional devices may be defined using Sailfish IDE (Qt Creator). Devices corresponding to available Sailfish OS emulators are added automatically. Emulators can be managed and controlled using the 'emulator' command. Packages can be deployed to a device with the 'deploy' command. The device to deploy to is determined by the 'device' configuration option.",

If the '--available' option is used, emulators available for installation from SDK repositories are listed, including those already installed. The status flags that may appear in the output are described further below.\n\nThose of the other commands that accept a <name-or-idx> argument, can be passed an emulator name or index as reported by the 'list' command without the '--available' option used. If a <name-or-idx> argument is omitted, the emulator at index '0' is assumed.\n\nEmulators available from SDK repositories may be installed using the 'install' command. Installed emulators may be removed using the 'remove' command. The 'install' and 'remove' commands accept <name> as reported by the 'list' command with '--available' option used (in case it differs in the view provided without '--available').\n\nThe 'start' and 'stop' commands allow to control the emulator virtual machine conveniently. Starting an emulator explicitly is usually not required - commands that need the emulator running will ensure it is running. The 'status' command prints status information.\n\nEmulator properties can be set with the 'set' command and queried with the 'show' command. Known properties are described further below.\n\nThe 'exec' command allows executing an arbitrary <command> inside the emulator. If no <command> is specified, an interactive shell is executed.\n\n\nStatus flags:\n\navailable\n    Emulator available from SDK repositories, available for installation using the 'install' command.\n\ninstalled\n    Emulator available from SDK repositories, currently installed\n\nsdk-provided\n    Synonym for 'installed'.

The maximum is limited by the number of CPUs available on the host.\n\nvm.memorySize <megabytes>\n    The amount of memory (RAM) available to the emulator virtual machine. The maximum is limited by the size of the physical memory available on the host.\n\nvm.storageSize <megabytes>\n    The amount of storage (disk) space available to the emulator virtual machine. Storage size can only grow; shrinking is not possible."
